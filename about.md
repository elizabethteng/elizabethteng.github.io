title: "About Me"
---

I grew up in New Jersey, but the beautiful city of Chicago has been my home since I moved here for graduate school at Northwestern University. I am currently in the final year of my PhD and planning to graduate in 2025. 

I have interests in public transit and urbanization. 

Outside of my work, I like to spend my time doing static trapeze, gardening, and making art.
