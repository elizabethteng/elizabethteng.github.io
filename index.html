  <div class="description my-4">
    <p>Hello!</p>

    <p>I am a second-year PhD student at the <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley School of Information</a>, where I work with <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/people/deirdre-mulligan">Professor Deirdre Mulligan</a> to study how sociopolitical advocates respond to and employ technological and algorithmic tools. I am also an affiliate of the Harvard <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society</a> for the 2022-23 academic year.</p>
      
      
      
    <p>I am a third-year Astronomy PhD student at Northwestern University, working with Professor Vicky Kalogera. I work on building machine learning models to emulate interior stellar structures at the end of binary evolution, as part of the population synthesis code <a href="https://posydon.org/">POSYDON</a>. </p>

 

    <p>I have done research in planet formation during an REU and my undergraduate thesis with Dr. Ryan Loomis (NRAO) and Dr. Patrick Sheehan (Northwestern U). In May 2020 I received my BS in Physics and Astronomy from Haverford College, where I worked in pulsar timing with Professor Andrea Lommen.  </p>

    <p> Previously, I was the staff technologist at the <a href="https://www.aclum.org/" target="_blank">ACLU of Massachusetts</a> in Boston, where I worked on the <a href="https://www.aclum.org/en/technology-liberty" target="_blank">Technology for Liberty Project</a> directed by Kade Crockford. My role included exploring and visualizing government data in order to inform citizens about the effects of legislation and political leadership, managing our <a href="https://data.aclum.org/" target="_blank">Data for Justice</a> site, and generally supporting ACLUM campaigns that operate at the intersection of technology and civil liberties.</p> 

    <p>Before joining the ACLU, I was a Research and Instrument Analyst for the James Webb Space Telescope mission at <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/" target="_blank">Space Telescope Science Institute</a> in Baltimore, Maryland. Originally from Hampton, VA, I received my B.S. from Yale in 2017, where I double-majored in astrophysics and African American studies.</p>

    <p>My personal experience <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/a-break-up-letter-with-astronomy-from-a-young-black-woman-a30de24fe209" target="_blank">leaving astronomy</a> and finding a career path applying quantitative analytic methods to social problems was far from straightforward -- for those interested in pursuing similar questions, I maintain a <a href="datajustice.html">webpage</a> of organizations, programs, and thinkers who work at the convergence of data/tech/computation and society/justice/ethics.</p>

    <p>I invite you to listen to a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Z1dAolRpfuYqkXRodkXu1" target="_blank">civic technology podcast<a> that I was a guest on last year where I discuss my experiences as a Black woman in astronomy, my journey into public interest technology, and our data advocacy work at ACLU-MA:</p>

    <p>I am immensely passionate about working towards equity and inclusion in all of the spaces that I occupy.</p>

    <p>Please feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> with any questions or inquiries!</p>

    <p>P.S. Two of my favorite things are Wikipedia (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future" target="_blank">hmm?</a>) and Google Maps. I actively curate four <a href="maps.html">maps</a> with my recommendations for where to eat and what to do in the Bay Area, Boston, Baltimore, and NYC.</p>
