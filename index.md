    <p>Hello!</p>
            
    <p>I am a fifth-year Astronomy PhD student at Northwestern University, working with Professor Vicky Kalogera. I work on building machine learning models to emulate interior stellar structures at the end of binary evolution, as part of the population synthesis code <a href="https://posydon.org/">POSYDON</a>. </p>
