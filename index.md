    <p>Hello!</p>
            
    <p>I am a third-year Astronomy PhD student at Northwestern University, working with Professor Vicky Kalogera. I work on building machine learning models to emulate interior stellar structures at the end of binary evolution, as part of the population synthesis code <a href="https://posydon.org/">POSYDON</a>. </p>

    <p>I have done research in planet formation during an REU and my undergraduate thesis with Dr. Ryan Loomis (NRAO) and Dr. Patrick Sheehan (Northwestern U). In May 2020 I received my BS in Physics and Astronomy from Haverford College, where I worked in pulsar timing with Professor Andrea Lommen.  </p>
