I am a fifth-year Astronomy PhD student at Northwestern University, working with Professor Vicky Kalogera. I work on building machine learning models to emulate interior stellar structures at the end of binary evolution, as part of the population synthesis code POSYDON. 

I have shared a project in computational imaging on my (GitHub)[https://github.com/elizabethteng/elizabethteng.github.io/blob/main/Teng_project.ipynb].
